# Collaborative Canvas (Firebase Realtime Database)

This is a static web app that lets multiple users draw on a shared canvas in real time using Firebase Realtime Database.

Features
- Smooth brush drawing synchronized across clients
- Color picker and brush size control
- Eraser mode (destination-out)
- Admin-only “Clear All” button (prompts for admin key on load)

Project layout
- index.html: App entry point for GitHub Pages
- collab.js: App logic (includes your Firebase initialization exactly as provided)
- collab.html: Alternate entry with the same UI (optional)
- style.css / script.js: Original scaffold (unused by the new entry point)

Run locally
- Open index.html directly in your browser. No build step is required.

Deploy to GitHub Pages
1) Commit and push to GitHub:
   - Initialize git if needed and push this folder to a GitHub repository.
2) Enable Pages:
   - In your GitHub repo: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main, Folder: /(root)
3) Visit the GitHub Pages URL shown in the Pages settings. It will serve index.html by default.

Admin key
- On page load you’ll be prompted for an admin key. Enter "cooper" to reveal the Clear All button.
- Clicking Clear All removes the `lines` node in the database for everyone.

Firebase notes
- The Firebase web config embedded here is client-side and not a secret. Ensure your Realtime Database rules are configured appropriately (e.g., authenticated only, rate-limited, and write-protected as needed).
